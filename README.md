HarpJS blog boilerplate based on TufteCSS

Lately I have been on the hunt for a blog boilerplate that has a strong focus on typography and design, while remaining functional. Unfortunately, most "design" focused boilerplates tend to be flashy, or incorporate too many fonts for my liking.

I found Tufte CSS a few days ago, and quickly fell in love with it's simple elegance. 

This is configured this to work pretty nicely as a blog for HarpJS.
