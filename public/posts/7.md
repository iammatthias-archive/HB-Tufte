  <h2 id="imagequilts">ImageQuilts</h2>
  <p>Tufte CSS provides support for Edward Tufte and Adam Schwartzâ€™s <a href="http://imagequilts.com/">ImageQuilts</a>. Some have ragged edges, others straight. Include these images just as you would any other <span class="code">figure</span>.</p>
  <p>This is an ImageQuilt surveying Chinese calligraphy, placed in a full-width figure to accomodate its girth:</p>
  <figure class="fullwidth"><img src="/assets/img/imagequilt-chinese-calligraphy.png" alt="Image of Chinese Calligraphy"/></figure>
  <p>Here is an ImageQuilt of 47 animal sounds over and over, in a figure constrained to the main text region. This quilt has ragged edges, but the image itself is of course still rectangular.</p>
  <figure><img src="/assets/img/imagequilt-animal-sounds.png" alt="Image of animal sounds"/></figure>
