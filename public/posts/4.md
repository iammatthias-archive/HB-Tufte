      <blockquote>
        <p>The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</p>
        <footer>George Orwell, “Politics and the English Language”</footer>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.</p>
        <footer>Richard P. Feynman, <cite>“What Do You Care What Other People Think?”</cite></footer>

      <blockquote>I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.<footer>Henri Matisse, <cite>Henri Matisse Dessins: thèmes et variations</cite> (Paris, 1943), 37</footer></blockquote>

    <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are <span class="code">blockquote</span> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a <span class="code">footer</span> element inside the <span class="code">blockquote</span>. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.</p>
